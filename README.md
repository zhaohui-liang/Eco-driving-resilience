# Vehicle Controller System (ROS 2)

## ðŸš— Overview

This ROS 2-based project simulates a vehicle controller that:

- Receives real-time GPS and velocity data
- Predicts and generates safe trajectories based on traffic light state and distance to intersection
- Publishes control commands as `TwistStamped` messages
- Logs predicted and actual vehicle trajectories for analysis

---

## ðŸ“¦ Packages

### 1. `vehicle_controller`
- Core logic for trajectory generation and vehicle control
- Includes signal input handling, socket communication, and control loop
- Parameters for traffic light cycle and vehicle dynamics are configurable

### 2. `vehicle_sender`
- communicate with vehicle control hardware

## ðŸ›  Features

- âœ… Sensor fusion using GPS and velocity (BESTVEL)
- âœ… Portabel trajectory generation module
- âœ… Traffic light logic with red/green/yellow phase awareness
- âœ… Acceleration phase to 5 m/s before normal control starts
- âœ… CSV logging for both predicted and actual trajectories
- âœ… Socket interface for SPaT (Signal Phase and Timing) input

## ðŸ§ª Dependencies

- ROS 2 (Humble or later)
- `geometry_msgs`, `rclcpp`
- `novatel_oem7_msgs` (for GPS/velocity input)
